              <h5 class="card-title">How to treate Malaria</h5>
              <p>The treatment of malaria depends on the type of parasite and the severity of the disease:
                <ol>
                  <li>Uncomplicated Malaria: This is treated using antimalarial drugs, often in combination to prevent resistance. The most common medications are:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs): These are the preferred treatment for P. falciparum malaria. Common ACTs include artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-amodiaquine.</li>
                    <li>Chloroquine: This is effective against P. vivax and P. ovale malaria, but many strains of P. falciparum have developed resistance to it.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Severe Malaria: In cases where malaria is life-threatening, treatment must be initiated as soon as possible with intravenous (IV) drugs such as:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Intravenous Artesunate: This is used for severe malaria caused by P. falciparum and is administered for 24-48 hours until the patient can take oral medications.</li>
                    <li>Quinine or Quinidine: Though less common today, these can be used in cases where artesunate is unavailable.</li>
                  </ul>
                  Preventive Treatment: For travelers or residents in high-risk areas, chemoprophylaxis (preventive medication) is recommended. Common preventive drugs include atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, and mefloquine.

                  Management of Symptoms: Supportive treatments like hydration, anti-fever medications, and blood transfusions (for severe anemia) may be necessary.
                </ol>
                Preventing Malaria
                Preventive measures include:

                Using insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs).
                Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) in homes to kill mosquitoes.
                Personal protective measures like wearing long-sleeved clothing and using mosquito repellents.
                With prompt and appropriate treatment, malaria can be effectively managed, preventing severe complications and saving lives.
